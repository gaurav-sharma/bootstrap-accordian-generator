bootstrap-accordian-generator
=============================
I rencently had to convert a FAQ given to me in a Word document to HTML. We use Bootstrap and the FAQ had to use the accordian functionality (http://getbootstrap.com/javascript/#collapse) provided by Bootstrap. This is not the first time I've had to do this. 

I figured I could simplify this process by having a tool that lets even a non-technical person generate this FAQ in the 
appropriate format. 

The first column lets you add the content, including HTML content. The second lets you see the results of what you addded. The third is the generated HTML code that can be copy/pasted and given to a programmer as is.
